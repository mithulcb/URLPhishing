## Introduction

The internet has integrated seamlessly into our daily lives, but it has also made it possible to carry out harmful acts like phishing invisibly.
Phishers attempt to trick their victims by employing social engineering techniques or building fake websites in order to obtain information such as account IDs, usernames, and passwords from people and businesses.
Although several strategies have been put out to identify phishing websites, phishers have developed ways to circumvent these strategies.
Machine learning is one of the best techniques for spotting these dangerous behaviours.
This is so that machine learning techniques can recognise the common traits shared by the majority of phishing attacks.

## Conclusion
->The final take away form this project is to explore various machine learning models, perform Exploratory Data Analysis on phishing dataset and understanding their features.<br>
->The final conclusion on the Phishing dataset is that the some feature like "HTTTPS", "AnchorURL", "WebsiteTraffic" have more importance to classify URL is phishing URL or not.<br>
->Gradient Boosting Classifier currectly classify URL upto 97.4% respective classes and hence reduces the chance of malicious attachments.
